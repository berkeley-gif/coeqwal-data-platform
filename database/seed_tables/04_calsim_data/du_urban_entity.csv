The water supply is conveyed primarily via the Drum, Bear River, and lower Boardman canals. Nevada ID and Placer County WA share capacity in the canal with agreements that provide for use of any unused capacity by either agency. 8 Placer County WA has several wells in the Western Placer County (Sunset Industrial Park) and is considering increasing groundwater capacity for meeting future conjunctive requirements. 9 The City of Lincoln purchases treated surface water from Placer County WA, which is used conjunctively with treated groundwater for urban uses and use of recycled water for agricultural irrigation from its wastewater treatment plant. 10 The City of Roseville purchases a small portion of treated Placer County WA water for service to higher elevation developments. 11 The Sacramento International Airport is currently on groundwater supplies with poor water quality. It is anticipated that wholesale agreements with the City of Sacramento to treat and deliver Natomas Central Mutual Water Company water will replace groundwater supplies in the near future. 12 The Northgate service area of Sacramento County WA may be annexed to the City of Sacramento in the near future and receive water from the city. 13 The City of Roseville has been actively pursuing aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) for wells constructed within its retail service area. 14 Includes a portion of Granite Bay in Placer County. 15 This portion of the Sacramento Suburban WD was formerly served by Arcade WD North Highlands service area and Northridge WD. 16 This portion of the Sacramento Suburban WD was formerly served by Arcade WD Town and Country service area. 17 The older and much larger portion of Rio Linda Elverta Community WD relies solely on groundwater. The newer development is served surface water through agreements with San Juan WD. 18 Del Paso WD has an existing agreement for surface water with the City of Sacramento for American River Place of Use water if groundwater supplies become inadequate to meet demands. To date, this diversion has not occurred. 19 The City of Napa delivers treated water to the City of American Canyon. The City of Napa also delivers water to the Town of Yountville and California Veterans Home. 20 Sacramento County WA Vineyard Surface Water Treatment Plant was completion in 2011. 21 Agreements have been made with Natomas Central Mutual Water Company to deliver up 10,000 acre-feet per year to the City of Folsom south of Highway 50 sphere of influence Development Area. Conveyance will likely be through the East Bay Municipal Utility District/Sacramento County WA Freeport diversion to be operational by 2011. 22 Groundwater contamination has reduced groundwater production over the past 10 years, increasing the need for surface water from the Folsom South Canal. 23 California American WC and Sacramento County WA are negotiating surface water wholesale agreements with the City of Sacramento for American River Place of Use. 24 Contra Costa Water District also serves parts of Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Martinez, and Brentwood. 25 EBMUD's water system covers a 331-square-mile area extending from Crockett on the north, southward to San Lorenzo, eastward from San Francisco to Walnut Creek, and south through the San Ramon Valley.
